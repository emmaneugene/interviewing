## Definition

**Process:**
A process is an instance of a computer program that is being executed. It contains the program code and its current activity. Each process has its own memory space.

**Thread:**
A thread is the smallest unit of execution within a process. A process can have multiple threads running concurrently, and they share the process's resources.

## Key Differences

1. **Memory Space:**
   - Process: Each process has its own memory space.
   - Thread: All threads within a process share the same memory space.

2. **Resource Allocation:**
   - Process: Processes are allocated separate memory and resources.
   - Thread: Threads share resources of the process they belong to.

3. **Creation and Termination:**
   - Process: More time-consuming to create and terminate.
   - Thread: Faster to create and terminate.

4. **Communication:**
   - Process: Inter-process communication is more complex and slower.
   - Thread: Inter-thread communication is simpler and faster due to shared memory.

5. **Isolation:**
   - Process: One process cannot directly access the memory of another process.
   - Thread: Threads within the same process can access shared memory.

6. **Overhead:**
   - Process: Higher overhead due to separate memory spaces and resources.
   - Thread: Lower overhead as they share resources.

7. **Stability:**
   - Process: If one process crashes, it generally doesn't affect other processes.
   - Thread: If a thread crashes, it can potentially crash the entire process.

8. **Parallel Execution:**
   - Process: Can achieve true parallelism on multi-core systems.
   - Thread: Can achieve concurrency and potential parallelism if the system supports it.

## Use Cases

**Processes are better for:**
- Running independent tasks
- Improved security and stability
- Taking advantage of multiple CPU cores for parallel processing

**Threads are better for:**
- Tasks that need to share data quickly
- Responsive user interfaces
- I/O-bound tasks where concurrency can improve performance

## Example Scenario

Imagine a web browser:
- Each tab could be a separate process for isolation and stability.
- Within each tab (process), multiple threads might handle different tasks:
  - One thread for rendering the page
  - Another for handling user input
  - A third for network communications
