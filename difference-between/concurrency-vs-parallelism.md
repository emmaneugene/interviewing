**Concurrency** is about dealing with multiple things at once, while **parallelism** is about doing multiple things at once.

**Concurrency** focuses on the _structure_ of a program - how you organize code to handle multiple tasks that may overlap in time. It's about managing and coordinating multiple activities, even if they're not literally happening simultaneously. Think of a single-core processor switching rapidly between tasks, or a waiter managing multiple tables by taking an order here, delivering food there, then checking on another table.

**Parallelism** focuses on _execution_ - literally performing multiple operations simultaneously using multiple processing units. This requires actual hardware support like multiple CPU cores, GPUs, or distributed systems. Think of multiple workers on an assembly line, each handling different parts of the process at the same time.

**Key distinctions:**

- **Concurrency without parallelism**: One core rapidly switching between tasks (cooperative multitasking, event loops, coroutines)
- **Parallelism without concurrency**: Multiple cores each working on completely independent problems
- **Both together**: Multiple cores each handling concurrent tasks (most modern applications)

**Common examples:**

- **Concurrent**: Async/await in JavaScript, Go goroutines, Python asyncio
- **Parallel**: Multi-threaded computations, MapReduce, parallel for loops
- **Both**: Web servers handling thousands of concurrent connections across multiple CPU cores

The confusion often arises because many systems use both concepts together, but they solve different problems: concurrency helps with coordination and resource utilization, while parallelism helps with raw computational speed.
